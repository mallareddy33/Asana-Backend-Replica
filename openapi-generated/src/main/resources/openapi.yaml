    Asana's audit log is an immutable log of [important events](/docs/audit-log-events#supported-audit-log-events) in your organization's Asana instance.

    The audit log API allows you to monitor and act upon important security and compliance-related changes. Organizations might use this API endpoint to:

    * Set up proactive alerting with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool like [Splunk](https://asana.com/guide/help/api/splunk)
    * Conduct reactive investigations when a security incident takes place
    * Visualize key domain data in aggregate to identify security trends

    Note that since the API provides insight into what is happening in an Asana instance, the data is [read-only](/reference/getauditlogevents). That is, there are no "write" or "update" endpoints for audit log events.

    Only [Service Accounts](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts) in [Enterprise Domains](https://asana.com/enterprise) can access audit log API endpoints. Authentication with a Service Account's [personal access token](/docs/personal-access-token) is required.

    For a full list of supported events, see [supported AuditLogEvents](/docs/audit-log-events#supported-audit-log-events).

- description: |-
    There are many cases where you want to accomplish a variety of work in the Asana API but want to minimize the number of HTTP requests you make. For example:

    * Modern browsers limit the number of requests that a single web page can
      make at once.
    * Mobile apps will use more battery life to keep the cellular radio on
      when making a series of requests.
    * There is an overhead cost to developing software that can make multiple
      requests in parallel.
    * Some cloud platforms handle parallelism poorly, or disallow it
      entirely.


    To make development easier in these use cases, Asana provides a **batch API** that enables developers to perform multiple “actions” by making only a single HTTP request.

    #### Making a batch request

    To make a batch request, send a `POST` request to `/batch`. Like other `POST` endpoints, the body should contain a `data` envelope. Inside this envelope should be a single `actions` field, containing a list of “action” objects.  Each action represents a standard request to an existing endpoint in the Asana API.

    **The maximum number of actions allowed in a single batch request is 10**. Making a batch request with no actions in it will result in a `400 Bad Request`.

    When the batch API receives the list of actions to execute, it will dispatch those actions to the already-implemented endpoints specified by the `relative_path` and `method` for each action. This happens in parallel, so all actions in the request will be processed simultaneously. There is no guarantee of the execution order for these actions, nor is there a way to use the output of one action as the input of another action (such as creating a task and then commenting on it).

    The response to the batch request will contain (within the `data` envelope) a list of result objects, one for each action. The results are guaranteed to be in the same order as the actions in the request (e.g., the first result in the response corresponds to the first action in the request)

    The batch API will always attempt to return a `200 Success` response with individual result objects for each individual action in the request. Only in certain cases (such as missing authorization or malformed JSON in the body) will the entire request fail with another status code. Even if every individual action in the request fails, the batch API will still return a `200 Success` response, and each result object in the response will contain the errors encountered with each action.

    #### Rate limiting

    The batch API fully respects all of our rate limiting. This means that a batch request counts against *both* the standard rate limiter and the concurrent request limiter as though you had made a separate HTTP request for every individual action. For example, a batch request with five actions counts as five separate requests in the standard rate limiter, and counts as five concurrent requests in the concurrent request limiter. The batch request itself incurs no cost.

    If any of the actions in a batch request would exceed any of the enforced limits, the *entire* request will fail with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. This is to prevent the unpredictability of which actions might succeed if not all of them could succeed.

    #### Restrictions

    Not every endpoint can be accessed through the batch API. Specifically, the following actions cannot be taken and will result in a `400 Bad Request` for that action:

    * Uploading attachments
    * Creating, getting, or deleting organization exports
    * Any SCIM operations
    * Nested calls to the batch API

    A *budget* object represents a budget for a specific *parent* resource (such as a project).

    Each budget tracks values either in *time* or *cost*, as determined by the *budget_type* field.

    When *budget_type* is `time`, all values are expressed in minutes. When *budget_type* is `cost`, all values are expressed in the domain’s currency.

    A budget can include up to three value objects: *estimate*, *actual*, and *total*. Each contains a `value`, `units`, and may include a `billable_status_filter` field.

    **estimate** Represents the aggregated estimated effort on tasks attributed to the *parent*. For time budgets: total estimated minutes. For cost budgets: total estimated cost, computed as (estimated time × resource rate).

    **actual** Represents the aggregated actual time logged on tasks attributed to the *parent*. For time budgets: total actual minutes from time tracking entries. For cost budgets: total actual cost, computed as (actual time × resource rate). The optional `billable_status_filter` limits aggregation to `billable`, `non_billable`, or `any` entries.

    **total** A user-defined target value for the budget. Stored independently per budget type, so switching between *time* and *cost* preserves each type's value. For time budgets: stored and read as minutes. For cost budgets: stored and read in the domain's currency.

    _Note: Custom fields are a premium feature. Integrations which work with custom fields need to handle an assortment of use cases for free and premium users in context of free and premium organizations. For a detailed examination of which data users will have access in different circumstances, review the section below on access control._

    In the Asana application, tasks, projects, and portfolios can hold user-specified [custom fields](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/custom-fields) which provide extra information (e.g., a "priority" property with an associated value, or a number representing the time required to complete a task). This lets a user define the type of information that each item within a project or portfolio can contain in addition to the built-in fields that Asana provides.
    `display_value` is a read-only field that will always be a string. For apps that use custom fields, this is a great way to safely display/export the value of a custom field, regardless of its type. We suggest apps use this field in order to future-proof for changes to custom fields.

    #### Characteristics of custom fields

    * There is metadata that defines the custom field. This metadata can be shared across an entire workspace, or be specific to a project or portfolio.
    * Creating a custom field setting on a project or portfolio means each direct child will have the custom field. This is conceptually akin to adding columns in a database or a spreadsheet: every task (row) in the project (table) can contain information for that field, including "blank" values (i.e., `null` data). For portfolio custom fields, every project (row) in the portfolio (table) will contain information for the custom field.
    * Custom field settings only go one child deep. This means that a custom field setting on a portfolio will give each project the custom field, but not each task within those projects.
    * Tasks have custom field _values_ assigned to them.

    #### Types of custom fields

    Integrations using custom fields need to be aware of the six basic types that a custom field can adopt. These types are:

    * `text` - an arbitrary, relatively short string of text
    * `number` - a number with a defined level of precision
    * `enum` - a selection of a single option from a defined list of options (i.e., mutually exclusive selections)
    * `multi_enum` - a selection of one or more options from a defined list of options (i.e., mutually inclusive selections)
    * `date` - a reference date with an optional time value
    * `people` - a list of active contributors (i.e., where their relationship to the work is defined in the custom field title)

    #### Example use case

    Consider an organization that has defined a custom field for "Priority". This field is of `enum` type and can have user-defined values of `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`. This is the field metadata, and it is visible within, and shared across, the entire organization.

    A project is then created in the organization, called "Bugs", and the "Priority" custom field is associated with that project. This will allow all tasks within the "Bugs" project to have an associated "Priority".

    A new task is created within "Bugs". This task, then, has a field named "Priority" which can take on the custom field value of one of `[null]`, `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.

    #### Custom fields in the API

    These custom fields are accessible via the API through a number of endpoints at the top level (e.g. `/custom_fields` and `/custom_field_settings`) and through requests on workspaces, portfolios, projects, and tasks resources. The API also provides a way to fetch both the metadata and data which define each particular custom field, so that a client application may render proper UI to display or edit the values.

    Text fields are currently limited to 1024 characters. On tasks, their custom field value will have a `text_value` property to represent this field.

    Number fields can have an arbitrary `precision` associated with them; for example, a precision of `2` would round its value to the second (hundredths) place (e.g., `1.2345` would round to `1.23`). On tasks, the custom field value will have a `number_value` property to represent this field.

    #### Enum fields

    Enum fields represent a selection from a list of options. On the metadata, they will contain all of the options in an array. Each option has 4 properties:

    * `gid` - the GID of this enum option. Note that this is the GID of the individual _option_. The custom field itself has a separate `gid`.
    * `name` - the name of the option (e.g., "Choice #1")
    * `enabled` - whether this field is enabled. Disabled fields are not available to choose from when disabled, and are visually hidden in the Asana application, but they remain in the metadata for custom field values which were set to the option before the option was disabled.
    * `color` - a color associated with this choice.

    On the task's custom field value, the enum will have an `enum_value` property which will be the same as one of the choices from the list defined in the custom field metadata.

    #### Querying an organization for its custom fields

    For custom fields shared across the workspace or organization, the workspace [can be queried](/reference/getcustomfieldsforworkspace) for its list of defined custom fields. Like other collection queries, the fields will be returned as a compact record; slightly different from most other compact records is the fact that the compact record for custom fields includes `type` as well as `gid` and `name`.

    #### Accessing custom field definitions

    The [custom fields](/reference/getcustomfield) reference describes how the metadata which defines a custom field is accessed. A GET request with a `gid` can be issued on the `/custom_fields` endpoint to fetch the full definition of a single custom field given its `gid` from (for instance) listing all custom fields on a workspace, or getting the `gid` from a custom field settings object or a task.

    #### Associating custom fields with a project or portfolio

    A mapping between a custom field and a project or portfolio is handled with a [custom field settings](/reference/custom-field-settings) object. This object contains a reference for each of the custom fields and the project or portfolio, as well as additional information about the status of that particular custom field (e.g., `is_important`, which defines whether or not the custom field will appear in the list/grid on the Asana application).

    #### Accessing custom field values on tasks or projects

    The [tasks](/reference/gettask) reference has information on how custom fields look on tasks. custom fields will return as an array on the property `custom_fields`, and each entry will contain, side-by-side, the compact representation of the custom field metadata and a `{typename}_value` property that stores the value set for the custom field.

    Of particular note is that the top-level `gid` of each entry in the `custom_fields` array is the `gid` of the custom field metadata, as it is the compact representation of this metadata. This can be used to refer to the full metadata by making a request to the `/custom_fields/{custom_fields_id}` endpoint as described above.

    Custom fields can be set just as in the Asana-defined fields on a task via `POST` or `PUT` requests. You can see an example in the [update a task](/reference/updatetask) endpoint.

    Custom fields on projects follow this same pattern.

    #### Warning: Program defensively with regards to custom field definitions

    Asana application users have the ability to change the definitions of custom field metadata. This means that as you write scripts or applications to work with them, it is possible for the definitions to change at any time, which may cause an application using them to break or malfunction if it makes assumptions about the metadata for a particular custom field. When using custom fields, it is a good idea to program *defensively*, meaning you your application should double-check that the custom field metadata are what it expects.

    Storing the state of the custom field metadata for too long if you dynamically create a model for it can cause your model to become out of sync with the model stored in Asana. For example, if you encounter an `enum` value on a task that does not match any option in your metadata model, your metadata model has become out of date with the custom field metadata.

    #### Enabled and disabled values

    When information that is contained in a custom field value loses a logical association with its metadata definition, the value becomes disabled. This can happen in a couple of simple ways, for example, if you remove the custom field metadata from a project, or move a task with a custom field to a different project which does not have the custom field metadata associated with it. The value remains on the task, and the custom field metadata can still be found and examined, but as the context in which the custom field makes sense is gone, the custom field cannot change its value; it can only be cleared.

    _Note: Tasks that are associated with multiple projects do not become disabled, so long as at least one of the projects is still associated with the custom field metadata. In other words, tasks with multiple projects will retain logically associated to the set of custom field metadata represented by all of their projects._

    Moving the task back under a project with that custom field applied to it or applying the custom field metadata to the current project will return the custom field value to an enabled state. In this scenario, the custom field will be re-enabled and editable again.

    In the Asana application, disabled fields are grayed out and not allowed to change, other than to be discarded. In the API, we return a property `enabled: false` to inform the external application that the value has been disabled.

    Note that the API enforces the same operations on disabled custom field values as hold in the Asana application: they may not have their values changed, since the lack of context for the values of a custom field in general doesn't provide enough information to know what new values should be. Setting the custom field value to `null` will clear and remove the custom field value from the task.

    #### Custom field access control

    Custom fields are a complex feature of the Asana platform, and their access in the Asana application and in the API vary based on the status of the user and project. When building your application, it is best to be defensive and not assume the given user will have read or write access to a custom field, and fail gracefully when this occurs.

- description: |-
    An event is an object representing a change to a resource that was observed by an event subscription. Event streams rely on the same infrastructure as webhooks, which ensures events are delivered within a minute (on average). This system is designed for at most once delivery, meaning in exceptional circumstances a small number of events may be missing from the stream. For this reason, if your use case requires strong guarantees about processing all changes on a resource and cannot tolerate any missing events, regardless of how rare that might be, we recommend building a fallback polling system that fetches the resource periodically as well. Note that while webhooks cannot be replayed once delivered, events are retrievable from the event stream for 24 hours after being processed.

    In general, requesting events on a resource is faster and subject to higher rate limits than requesting the resource itself. Additionally, change events "bubble up" (e.g., listening to events on a project would include when stories are added to tasks in the project, and even to subtasks).

    Establish an initial sync token by making a request with no sync token. The response will be a `412 Precondition Failed` error - the same as if the sync token had expired.

    Subsequent requests should always provide the sync token from the immediately preceding call.

    Sync tokens may not be valid if you attempt to go "backward" in the history by requesting previous tokens, though re-requesting the current sync token is generally safe, and will always return the same results.

    When you receive a `412 Precondition Failed` error, it means that the sync token is either invalid or expired. If you are attempting to keep a set of data in sync, this signals you may need to re-crawl the data.

    Sync tokens always expire after 24 hours, but may expire sooner, depending on load on the service.

    Exports are a way to download data from Asana. The following types of exports are available:
    * **Graph exports**: Export of data about objects starting from a parent object, such as a team, portfolio, or project.
    * **Resource exports**: Bulk exports of resources such as tasks, teams, and messages for a workspace.
    * **Organization exports**: Exports the complete data of an organization in JSON format. Please refer to [Organization exports](/reference/organization-exports) for more details.

    ## Graph exports
    A `graph_export` object represents a request to export the
    data about objects starting from a parent object. Parent object can be a team, portfolio, or project.

    To create an export using this API:
    1. Create a `graph_export` [request](/reference/createGraphExport) and store the ID that is returned.
    2. Request the [jobs](/reference/getjob) endpoint every few minutes, until `status` field contains 'succeeded'.
    3. Download the file located at the URL in the `download_url` field.

    Exports can take a long time, from several minutes to a few hours for large portfolios.

    *Note: Graph exports are only available to accounts of an
    [Enterprise](https://asana.com/enterprise)/Enterprise+ organization.*

    ## Resource exports
    A `resource_export` object represents a request to bulk export resources for a workspace.
    To create an export using this API:
    1. Create a `resource_export` [request](/reference/createResourceExport) and store the job ID that is returned.
    2. Request the [jobs](/reference/getjob) endpoint at some interval, until `status` field contains 'succeeded' and a `download_url` is available.
    3. Download the file located at the URL in the `download_url` field.

    Exports can take a long time, from several minutes to a few hours for large workspaces.

    Jobs represent processes that handle asynchronous work. A job created when an endpoint requests an action that will be handled asynchronously, such as project or task duplication.

    Only the creator of the duplication process can access the duplication status of the new object.

    *Note*: With any work that is handled asynchronously (e.g., [project instantation from a template](/reference/instantiateproject), duplicating a [task](/reference/duplicatetask) or [project](/reference/duplicateproject), etc.), the *intermittent states* of newly-created objects may not be consistent. That is, object properties may return different values each time when polled until the job `status` has returned a `succeeded` value.

    A project represents a prioritized list of tasks in Asana or a board with columns of tasks represented as cards. A project exists in a single workspace or organization and is accessible to a subset of users in that workspace or organization, depending on its permissions.

    Projects in organizations are shared with a single team. Currently, the team of a project cannot be changed via the API. Non-organization workspaces do not have teams and so you should not specify the team of project in a regular workspace.

    Followers of a project are a subset of the members of that project. Followers of a project will receive all updates including tasks created, added and removed from that project. Members of the project have access to and will receive status updates of the project. Adding followers to a project will add them as members if they are not already, removing followers from a project will not affect membership.

    **Note:** You can use certain project endpoints to operate on [user task lists](/reference/user-task-lists) ([My Tasks](https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/my-tasks)) by substituting the `{project_gid}` with the `{user_task_list_gid}`. For example, you can perform operations on the custom fields of a user task list by using the following projects endpoints: [Add a custom field to a project](/reference/addcustomfieldsettingforproject), [Remove a custom field from a project](/reference/removecustomfieldsettingforproject) and [Get a project's custom fields](/reference/getcustomfieldsettingsforproject)

    To support cross-application workflows, the API supports
    [incoming web requests](https://developers.asana.com/docs/incoming-web-requests) as a generic trigger to

    A section is a subdivision of a project that groups tasks together. It can either be a header above a list of tasks in a list view or a column in a board view of a project.

    Sections are largely a shared idiom in Asana’s API for both list and board views of a project regardless of the project’s layout.

    The ‘memberships’ property when [getting a task](/reference/gettask) will return the information for the section or the column under ‘section’ in the response.

    A status update is an update on the progress of a particular object,
    and is sent out to all followers when created. These updates
    include both text describing the update and a `status_type` intended to
    represent the overall state of the project. These include: `on_track` for projects that
    are on track, `at_risk` for projects at risk, `off_track` for projects that
    are behind, and `on_hold` for projects on hold.

    Status updates can be created and deleted, but not modified.

    *See [our forum post](https://forum.asana.com/t/no-more-parsing-story-text-new-fields-on-stories/42924) for more info on when conditional fields are returned.*

    A story represents an activity associated with an object in the Asana system. Stories are generated by the system whenever users take actions such as creating or assigning tasks, or moving tasks between projects. "Comments" are also a form of user-generated story.
  name: Stories

    A tag is a label that can be attached to any task in Asana. It exists in a single workspace or organization.

    Tags have some metadata associated with them, but it is possible that we will simplify them in the future so it is not encouraged to rely too heavily on it. Unlike projects, tags do not provide any ordering on the tasks they are associated with.
  name: Tags
- description: |-
    The task is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are centered. In the Asana application, multiple tasks populate the middle pane according to some view parameters, and the set of selected tasks determines the more detailed information presented in the details pane.

    Sections are unique in that they will be included in the `memberships` field of task objects returned in the API when the task is within a section. They can also be used to manipulate the ordering of a task within a project.

    [Queries](/reference/gettasks) return a [compact representation of each task object](/reference/tasks). To retrieve *all* fields or *specific set* of the fields, use [field selectors](/docs/inputoutput-options) to manipulate what data is included in a response.

    A task template is an object that allows new tasks to be created with a predefined setup, which may include followers, dependencies, custom fields, etc. It simplifies the process of running a workflow that involves a similar set of work every time.
    Task templates are contained within a single project.

    A user object represents an account in Asana that can be given access to various workspaces, projects, and tasks.

    Like other objects in the system, users are referred to by numerical IDs. However, the special string identifier `me` can be used anywhere a user ID is accepted, to refer to the current authenticated user (e.g, `GET /users/me`).

    Webhooks allow you to subscribe to notifications about events that occur on Asana resources (e.g., tasks, projects, stories, etc.).

    A *workspace* is the highest-level organizational unit in Asana. All projects and tasks have an associated workspace.

    An *organization* is a special kind of workspace that represents a company. In an organization, you can group your projects into teams. You can read more about how organizations work on the Asana Guide. To tell if your workspace is an organization or not, check its `is_organization` property.

    Over time, we intend to migrate most workspaces into organizations and to release more organization-specific functionality. We may eventually deprecate using workspace-based APIs for organizations. Currently, and until after some reasonable grace period following any further announcements, you can still reference organizations in any `workspace` parameter.

        <b>Required scope: </b><code>attachments:read</code>

        Returns the compact records for all attachments on the object.
        There are three possible `parent` values for this request: `project`, `project_brief`, and `task`. For a project, an attachment refers to a file uploaded to the "Key resources" section in the project Overview. For a project brief, an attachment refers to inline files in the project brief itself. For a task, an attachment refers to a file directly associated to that task.

        Note that within the Asana app, inline images in the task description do not appear in the index of image thumbnails nor as stories in the task. However, requests made to `GET /attachments` for a task will return all of the images in the task, including inline images.

        Upload an attachment.

        This method uploads an attachment on an object and returns the compact
        record for the created attachment object. This is possible by either:

        - Providing the URL of the external resource being attached, or
        - Downloading the file content first and then uploading it as any other attachment. Note that it is not possible to attach
        files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box, Vimeo & Google Drive via the API

        The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.

        This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing the full contents of the file to be uploaded.

        Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line
        terminators are of the form `CRLF` or `\r\n` outlined
        [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules) in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.

        For file names that contain non-ASCII characters, the file name should be URL-encoded. For example, a file named `résumé.pdf` should be encoded as
        `r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf` and the `filename` parameter in the `Content-Disposition` header should be set to the encoded file name.

        Below is an example of a cURL request with the `Content-Disposition` header:

        ```
        export ASANA_PAT="<YOUR_ASANA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>"
        export PARENT_ID="<PARENT_GID>"
        export ENCODED_NAME="r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf"
        curl --location 'https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/attachments' \
          --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
          --header 'Accept: application/json' \
          --header "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_PAT" \
          --form "parent=$PARENT_ID" \
          --form "file=@/Users/exampleUser/Downloads/résumé.pdf;headers=\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="$ENCODED_NAME.pdf"; filename*=UTF-8''$ENCODED_NAME.pdf\""

          Be sure to add an `‘@’` before the file path, and use the `--form`
          option instead of the `-d` option.

          When uploading PDFs with curl, force the content-type to be pdf by

      description: |-
        Retrieve the audit log events that have been captured in your domain.

        This endpoint will return a list of [AuditLogEvent](/reference/audit-log-api) objects, sorted by creation time in ascending order. Note that the Audit Log API captures events from October 8th, 2021 and later. Queries for events before this date will not return results.

        There are a number of query parameters (below) that can be used to filter the set of [AuditLogEvent](/reference/audit-log-api) objects that are returned in the response. Any combination of query parameters is valid. When no filters are provided, all of the events that have been captured in your domain will match.

        The list of events will always be [paginated](/docs/pagination). The default limit is 1000 events. The next set of events can be retrieved using the `offset` from the previous response. If there are no events that match the provided filters in your domain, the endpoint will return `null` for the `next_page` field. Querying again with the same filters may return new events if they were captured after the last request. Once a response includes a `next_page` with an `offset`, subsequent requests can be made with the latest `offset` to poll for new events that match the provided filters.

        *Note: If the filters you provided match events in your domain and `next_page` is present in the response, we will continue to send `next_page` on subsequent requests even when there are no more events that match the filters. This was put in place so that you can implement an audit log stream that will return future events that match these filters. If you are not interested in future events that match the filters you have defined, you can rely on checking empty `data` response for the end of current events that match your filters.*

        When no `offset` is provided, the response will begin with the oldest events that match the provided filters. It is important to note that [AuditLogEvent](/reference/audit-log-api) objects will be permanently deleted from our systems after 90 days. If you wish to keep a permanent record of these events, we recommend using a SIEM tool to ingest and store these logs.

        Creates a new custom field in a workspace. Every custom field is required
        to be created in a specific workspace, and this workspace cannot be
        changed once set.

        A custom field’s name must be unique within a workspace and not conflict
        with names of existing task properties such as `Due Date` or `Assignee`.
        A custom field’s type must be one of `text`, `enum`, `multi_enum`, `number`,
        `date`, or `people`.

        Returns the full record of the newly created custom field.

        Get the complete definition of a custom field’s metadata.

        Since custom fields can be defined for one of a number of types, and
        these types have different data and behaviors, there are fields that are
        relevant to a particular type. For instance, as noted above, enum_options
        is only relevant for the enum type and defines the set of choices that
        the enum could represent. The examples below show some of these
        type-specific custom field definitions.

      parameters:

        An enum custom field’s `enum_options` cannot be updated with this endpoint. Instead see “Work With Enum Options” for information on how to update `enum_options`.
        Locked custom fields can only be updated by the user who locked the field.
        Returns the complete updated custom field record.

        lieu of including the resource ID in the data for the request.

        Asana limits a single sync token to 100 events. If more than 100 events exist
        for a given resource, `has_more: true` will be returned in the response, indicating
        that there are more events to pull.

The response will be the same as for an expired sync token, and will include a new valid sync token.If the sync token is too old (which may happen from time to time) the API will return a `412 Precondition Failed` error, and include a fresh sync token in the response.*

  /exports/resource:
    post:
      description: |-
        Initiates a bulk export of resources for a workspace. The export will be processed asynchronously. Once the export has been requested, its progress can be monitored using the [jobs](/reference/getjob) endpoint.

        ## Supported resource types
        This endpoint currently supports exporting tasks, teams and messages within a workspace. Resources can be requested to be part of the export by providing the `export_request_parameters` parameter. The following resource types are supported:

        ### Tasks:
        Tasks are formatted for exports with some differences from their documented [schema](/reference/tasks):
          - `attachments` are included by default and returns an array of associated attachments.
          - Attachment objects do not include `download_url` or `view_url`. The `attachments` [endpoint](/reference/attachment) should be queried for up-to-date URLs.
          - `stories` are included by default and returns an array of comments and other changes made to a task

        ### Teams:
        Teams are formatted for exports with these differences from their documented [schema](/reference/teams):
          - `members` are included by default and returns an array of Users that are members of the team
          - Filtering is not supported for teams.

        ### Messages:
        The returned schema encompasses both default messages and status updates and is similar to the status update schema.
        The available fields for messages are:
          - `gid` - The globally unique identifier for the message.
          - `resource_type` - The type of resource, which is always "message".
          - `resource_subtype` - Optional. The subtype of the message, which can be "default" or "status_update".
          - `status_type` - The type associated with the status update. This can be one of: “on_track”, “at_risk”, “off_track”, “on_hold”, “complete”, “achieved”, “partial”, “missed”, “dropped”
          - `created_by` - The user who created the message.
          - `created_at` - The time at which this resource was created and sent available to other users.
          - `modified_at` - The time at which this resource was last modified.
          - `title` - The title of the message.
          - `text` - The text content of the message.
          - `html_notes` - The text content of the message with formatting as HTML. Not included by default. Can be included by using “fields” in the initial request.
          - `num_likes` - The number of users who have liked this message.
          - `likes` - An array of users who have liked this message.
          - `stories` - Optional. Array of stories applied to the message.
          - `attachments` - Optional. Array of attachments added to the message.
          - `followers` - Optional. Array of users currently following the message. Users that were sent the message are treated as followers.
          - `parents` - Array of objects the message was sent to. Can be a Project, Portfolio, Team or Goal. Limited to a single object for status updates.


        ## Export file
        The final export file will be in JSON Lines format and compressed in a gzip container.

        Objects are formatted according to their corresponding API schema, or limited to the fields
        included in the `fields` parameter. Exports currently include undeleted objects.

        An object in the export will be up to date anywhere between the exports `created_at` and `completed_at`. There is no guaranteed ordering of objects in the export.

        Access to the export file expires 30 days after its completion.

        ## Exporting specific fields
        By default, each object in an export includes a predefined set of fields based on its schema. If a more limited set of fields
        or fields not included by default are required, the Export API allows for specifying which fields to include in the requested export.

        Fields can be specified using the `fields` parameter. The fields parameter conforms to the fields
        optional parameter available for all Asana endpoints which is documented [here](https://developers.asana.com/docs/inputoutput-options).

        Utilizing the `fields` parameter is recommended if the full object is not required, especially when a large number of objects are being exported, to reduce the overall export time.

        ## Filtering resources
        A disjunction of two or more filters can be achieved by providing multiple `export_request_parameters` for the same resource, each with different filters.
        However, this approach may result in duplicate resources being returned.

        ## Rate Limits
        A workspace is currently limited to *one* in progress export request at a given time. The request will return with a 403 Forbidden status code if the limit is exceeded.

          Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.

          Provides “pretty” output.
          Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.

        Note that portfolios created in the Asana UI may have some state
        (like the “Priority” custom field) which is automatically added
        to the portfolio when it is created. Portfolios created via our
        API will *not* be created with the same initial state to allow
        integrations to create their own starting state on a portfolio.

          Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.

          Offset token.
          An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
          *Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.*

        Creates and returns a job that will asynchronously handle the project instantiation.

        To form this request, it is recommended to first make a request to [get a project template](/reference/getprojecttemplate). Then, from the response, copy the `gid` from the object in the `requested_dates` array. This `gid` should be used in `requested_dates` to instantiate a project.

        _Note: The body of this request will differ if your workspace is an organization. To determine if your workspace is an organization, use the [is_organization](/reference/workspaces) parameter._

        Create a new project in a workspace or team.

        Every project is required to be created in a specific workspace or
        organization, and this cannot be changed once set. Note that you can use
        the `workspace` parameter regardless of whether or not it is an
        organization.

        If the workspace for your project is an organization, you must also
        supply a `team` to share the project with.

        Returns the full record of the newly created project.

          Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.

        A specific, existing project can be updated by making a PUT request on
        the URL for that project. Only the fields provided in the `data` block
        will be updated; any unspecified fields will remain unchanged.

        When using this method, it is best to specify only those fields you wish
        to change, or else you may overwrite changes made by another user since
        you last retrieved the task.

        Returns the complete updated project record.
      operationId: updateProject
      parameters:
      - description: Globally unique identifier for the project.

          Provides “pretty” output.
          Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.

          Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.

        This endpoint has an additional [rate limit](/docs/rate-limits) and each field counts especially high against our [cost limits](/docs/rate-limits#cost-limits).

        Milestones are just tasks, so they are included in the `num_tasks`, `num_incomplete_tasks`, and `num_completed_tasks` counts.

        Adds the specified list of users as members of the project. Note that a user being added as a member may also be added as a *follower* as a result of this operation. This is because the user's default notification settings (i.e., in the "Notifications" tab of "My Profile Settings") will override this endpoint's default behavior of setting "Tasks added" notifications to `false`.

          Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.

          include assigning, renaming, completing, and adding stories.*

        Creating a new task is as easy as POSTing to the `/tasks` endpoint with a
        data block containing the fields you’d like to set on the task. Any
        unspecified fields will take on default values.

        Every task is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this
        workspace cannot be changed once set. The workspace need not be set
        explicitly if you specify `projects` or a `parent` task instead.

          Provides “pretty” output.
          Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.

        Returns the compact list of tasks in a user’s My Tasks list.
        *Note: Access control is enforced for this endpoint as with all Asana API endpoints, meaning a user’s private tasks will be filtered out if the API-authenticated user does not have access to them.*
        *Note: Both complete and incomplete tasks are returned by default unless they are filtered out (for example, setting `completed_since=now` will return only incomplete tasks, which is the default view for “My Tasks” in Asana.)*
      operationId: getTasksForUserTaskList
      parameters:
      - description: |
          Only return tasks that are either incomplete or that have been completed since this time. Accepts a date-time string or the keyword *now*.
        example: 2012-02-22T02:06:58.158Z

          Provides “pretty” output.
          Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
        example: true
        explode: true

          Results per page.
          The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100.
        example: 50
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: limit
        required: false
        schema:

      - description: |-
          Offset token.
          An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
          *Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.*

        Adds the task to the specified project, in the optional location
        specified. If no location arguments are given, the task will be added to
        the end of the project.

        `addProject` can also be used to reorder a task within a project or
        section that already contains it.

        At most one of `insert_before`, `insert_after`, or `section` should be
        specified. Inserting into a section in an non-order-dependent way can be
        done by specifying section, otherwise, to insert within a section in a
        particular place, specify `insert_before` or `insert_after` and a task
        within the section to anchor the position of this task.

        A task can have at most 20 projects multi-homed to it.

        Returns an empty data block.

        <b>Required scope: </b><code>tasks:read</code>

        To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app's advanced search feature, the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to build complex filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need.
        #### Premium access
        Like the Asana web product's advance search feature, this search endpoint will only be available to premium Asana users. A user is premium if any of the following is true:

        - The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace

        Even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace, not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error.
        #### Pagination
        Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because of this, the traditional [pagination](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#pagination) available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit` query parameter.
        #### Eventual consistency
        Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product.
        #### Rate limits
        You may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our [rate limits](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#rate-limits).
        #### Custom field parameters
        | Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type |
        |---|---|---|
        | custom_fields.{gid}.is_set | All | Boolean |
        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Text | String |
        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Number | Number |
        | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Enum | Enum option ID |
        | custom_fields.{gid}.starts_with | Text only | String |

        | custom_fields.{gid}.less_than | Number only | Number |
        | custom_fields.{gid}.greater_than | Number only | Number |


        For example, if the gid of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter to find tasks where it is set would be `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To match an exact value for an enum custom field, use the gid of the desired enum option and not the name of the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`.

        **Not Supported**: searching for multiple exact matches of a custom field, searching for multi-enum custom field

        *Note: If you specify `projects.any` and `sections.any`, you will receive tasks for the project **and** tasks for the section. If you're looking for only tasks in a section, omit the `projects.any` from the request.*

        <b>Required scope: </b><code>workspace.typeahead:read</code>

        Retrieves objects in the workspace based via an auto-completion/typeahead
        search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do
        not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The
        result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so
        you won’t be able to fetch large numbers of results.

        The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single
        workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when
        creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant
        to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or
        exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and
        cannot be paginated.

        Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically
        the gid and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of
        the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what
        data is included in a response.

        Resources with type `user` are returned in order of most contacted to
        least contacted. This is determined by task assignments, adding the user
        to projects, and adding the user as a follower to tasks, messages,
        etc.

        Resources with type `project` are returned in order of recency. This is
        determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project, and
        completes tasks in the project.

        Resources with type `task` are returned with priority placed on tasks
        the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks.

        Resources with type `project_template` are returned with priority
        placed on favorited project templates.

        Leaving the `query` string empty or omitted will give you results, still
        following the resource ordering above. This could be used to list users or
        projects that are relevant for the requesting user's api token.

        Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST
        request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource.

        Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake.
        When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an
        `X-Hook-Secret` header. The target must respond with a `200 OK` or `204
        No Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this
        webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing
        this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures.

        The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status
        of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation
        handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in
        response to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to
        receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight
        (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously).

        Invalid hostnames like localhost will receive a 403 Forbidden status code.

          An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results.
          *Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.*

        Remove a user from a workspace or organization.

        The user making this call must be an admin in the workspace. The user can
        be referenced by their globally unique user ID or their email address.

        When invoked using a **Service Account Token (SAT)**, this endpoint follows the same behavior as the
        [SCIM API Delete endpoint](/docs/scim).
        To learn more about how Asana handles user deprovisioning, refer to our
        [Help Center article on deprovisioning users](https://help.asana.com/s/article/user-deprovisioning).

        When invoked using a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**, the endpoint behaves similarly, except that
        ownership of the user’s resources is transferred to the **PAT owner** instead of the admin
        [specified in the Admin Console](https://help.asana.com/s/article/user-deprovisioning#gl-deprovisioning).

        **Note:** If you wish to retain access to a user’s private resources
        (i.e., those visible only to that user), you have to make them public manually
        (or ask the user to do so) before removal.

        Returns an empty data record.

        Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below.
        The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.

    EnumOption:
      description: |-
        Enum options are the possible values which an enum custom field can adopt. An enum custom field must contain at least 1 enum option but no more than 500.

        You can add enum options to a custom field by using the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options` endpoint.

        **It is not possible to remove or delete an enum option**. Instead, enum options can be disabled by updating the `enabled` field to false with the `PUT /enum_options/enum_option_gid` endpoint. Other attributes can be updated similarly.

        On creation of an enum option, `enabled` is always set to `true`, meaning the enum option is a selectable value for the custom field. Setting `enabled=false` is equivalent to “trashing” the enum option in the Asana web app within the “Edit Fields” dialog. The enum option will no longer be selectable but, if the enum option value was previously set within a task, the task will retain the value.

        Enum options are an ordered list and by default new enum options are inserted at the end. Ordering in relation to existing enum options can be specified on creation by using `insert_before` or `insert_after` to reference an existing enum option. Only one of `insert_before` and `insert_after` can be provided when creating a new enum option.

        An enum options list can be reordered with the `POST /custom_fields/custom_field_gid/enum_options/insert` endpoint.
      example:
        gid: "12345"

        Sadly, sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can

        In the event of a server error the response body will contain an error

    EventResponse:
      description: |-
        An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was
        observed by an event subscription or delivered asynchronously to
        the target location of an active webhook.

        The event may be triggered by a different `user` than the
        subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B
        modified it, the event's user will be user B. Note: Some events
        are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API
        consumers should make sure to handle this case.

        The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one
        that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For
        example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks
        contained within the project.

        **Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields
        `Event.action` and `Event.change.action`.
        `Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource
        itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information
        within the resource's fields have been modified.

        For instance, consider these scenarios:


        * When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be
        `added`, `Event.parent` will be an object with the `id` and
        `type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.


        * When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be
        `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
        `Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `new_value` will
        be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.


        * When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will
        be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
        `Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be
        an object with the user's `id` and `type`.
      example:
        parent: ""
        resource: ""
        change:
          added_value:
            gid: "12345"

        A *portfolio* gives a high-level overview of the status of multiple initiatives in Asana. Portfolios provide a dashboard overview of the state of multiple projects, including a progress report and the most recent [project status](/reference/project-statuses) update.
        Portfolios have some restrictions on size. Each portfolio has a max of 1500 items and, like projects, a max of 20 custom fields.

            A comma-separated list of elements to include when duplicating a project.
            Some elements are automatically included and cannot be excluded,
            while others are **optional** and must be explicitly specified in this field.

            **Auto-included fields (non-configurable)**
            - Tasks
            - [Project Views](https://asana.com/features/project-management/project-views)
            (i.e., tabs in a project such as List, Board, Dashboard, etc.)
            - [Rules](https://help.asana.com/s/article/rules)

            *Note: The Owner of the Rules copied to the new project is the user who performs the API call.
            If the duplication is performed using a [Service Account](/docs/authentication#/service-account),
            note that Service Accounts cannot access the UI to modify or pause Rules.
            To prevent unwanted automation behavior, consider pausing Rules in the source project before duplication —
            their active/paused state is preserved in the new project.*

            **Optional fields (configurable)**

            - forms
            - members

        *Deprecated: new integrations should prefer the `status_update` resource.*
        A *project status* is an update on the progress of a particular project, and is sent out to all project followers when created. These updates include both text describing the update and a color code intended to represent the overall state of the project: "green" for projects that are on track, "yellow" for projects at risk, and "red" for projects that are behind.
